## IBKR Flex Portfolio Analysis

This repository includes an Interactive Brokers Flex Web Service helper at
`scripts/ibkr-flex-query.sh`.

When the user asks to analyze their current portfolio, use this helper instead
of asking the user to manually export portfolio data.

Expected local configuration:

- `~/.ibkr/flex-queries.csv`
  - CSV columns: `account_id,query_name,query_id`
- `~/.ibkr/flex-tokens.csv`
  - CSV columns: `account_id,query_token`

Workflow for portfolio analysis:

1. Discover available accounts by reading `~/.ibkr/flex-tokens.csv`.
2. Cross-check those accounts against `~/.ibkr/flex-queries.csv` for a
   `portfolio` query.
3. If more than one account is available, show the user a menu of eligible
   account IDs and ask which account to analyze.
4. Run:

   ```sh
   scripts/ibkr-flex-query.sh ACCOUNT_ID portfolio
   ```

5. Treat the command output as the current portfolio state in CSV format and
   analyze it.

Do not print, expose, or ask the user to paste Flex tokens. Use the token only
through the local helper script and local configuration files.
